# The_Salesman
A repository for the text based game 'The Salesman' written in python.

Players are given a list of different items they need to try to sale,
and must try and sell them to a range of life forms all with unique dialogues,
and a random level of stubbornness, intellligence, wealth and friendliness.

The player's goal is to make as much money as possible, either before:

- They sell all the items on the given list
- They are arrested
- They die

Good luck!
(P.S. There is a rule book in game containing additional information)
